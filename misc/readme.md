# makeSymlink

makeSymlink is a script that makes a symbolic link to a simulation in your Tomcat directory. This script tries to guess your Tomcat path, username, and simulation name. Usually it can do what is desired by simply running `makeSymlink` or `makeSymlink SIM_NAME`. It also has options to override the guesses it makes for the Tomcat path and username. Run makeSymlink -h for more information.
